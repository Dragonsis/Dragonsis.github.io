                    <p style="color: black;"> <big> <b>I am </b></big> a student working on my Bachelors of Science Degree for Computer Information Technology at Northern Arizona University.<br>
                    During my studies, I realized the importance of Cybersecurity in today's technology-driven world.<br>
                    Children, such as my girls, and senior citizens, like my mother, should be more aware of the risks and best cyber practices.<br>
                    Therefore, I am creating this website to will help test and improve their knowledge and skills.<br>
                    Ultimately this website should improve anyone's confidence and ability to make good cyber choices and stay safe in cyberspace. </p>
